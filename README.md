Invest Game - 
a GUI based Java game where the player has to buy and sell stocks.
the main objective is to buy low and sell high to gain a profit.
game advances day by day and the new stock prices for the day are
calculated by a random function and volatility of the stock prices.

that is playable human vs computer
this contains a simple (but incomplete) AI that i made by myself.
the AI can recogonize when the human player is planning to complete
a line with three symbols and tries to block it.

after writing a significant amount of code i realized that my 
approach to the solution was wrong and it has to be coded again 
from the very beginning.
