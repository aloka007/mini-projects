Invest Game - 
A GUI based Java game where the player has to buy and sell stocks.
The main objective is to buy low and sell high to gain a profit.
Game advances day by day and the new stock prices for the day are
calculated by a random function and volatility of the stock prices.
(this game can be improved by adding multiple companies and random 
events that can cause sudden changes in the stock price)

TicTac -
A Tic Tac Toe game (below)
| X O X |
| - X O |
| - - X |
That is playable human vs computer.
This contains a simple (but incomplete) AI that i made by myself.
The AI can recogonize when the human player is planning to complete
a line with three symbols and tries to block it.

After writing a significant amount of code i realized that my 
approach to the solution was wrong and it has to be coded again 
from the very beginning.
